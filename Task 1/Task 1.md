# Tool Ideation Exercise

---

## 1. Introduction (137 words)

For this task, we were asked to utilise or make a tool that is helpful for production. As I am responsible for the game’s social media, I focused on researching tools that improve the marketing workflow. I looked into automation software (Metricool, s.d.) that can upload a post to multiple platforms at the same time (i.e., Instagram and TikTok), reducing the time spent posting manually. I also looked into utilising a Discord (Discord - Group Chat That’s All Fun & Games, s.d.) bot (YouTube, TikTok, Twitch and Kick.com Notifications on Discord!, s.d.) that posts an automatic notification in our public server whenever a new TikTok is uploaded, so our following is updated immediately without any extra steps. This is professionally relevant as game studios rely on efficient pipelines, and marketing is an important part of production. Automating repetitive tasks reduces human error, saves time, and keeps promotion consistent, which is incredibly important for a small team like ours.

## 2. Implementation (240 words)

### Tools/frameworks used: 

I chose Metricool as the main automation tool because it is free and combines scheduling, planning, and analytics in one dashboard.

For community notifications, I used the NotifyMe Discord bot to automatically alert our server when we upload on TikTok (TikTok, s.d.). Although I did not code these tools, I integrated them into our workflow as production systems to support the marketing side of development.

### Technical approach:

 I first created our social accounts, then linked them inside Metricool so posts could be drafted once and scheduled across platforms (e.g., Instagram (Instagram, s.d.) and TikTok). I can now use Metricool’s planner to organise upcoming posts and its analytics view to track follower growth and post performance without checking each platform separately, which streamlines the workflow and reduces manual steps.

### Key systems/configuration: 

The main system used here was the account linking and scheduling configuration inside Metricool (linked platforms, planner, and analytics dashboard). For Discord, I configured NotifyMe to monitor our TikTok account and post updates into a dedicated notifications channel.

 I also set up a separate bot section to avoid clutter and created a role-based opt-in ping, so only users who choose the role receive alerts.

### Challenges + fixes:

 I initially tested Buffer, but it would not link our TikTok account. Instead of dropping the automation idea, I researched alternatives and switched to Metricool, which resolved the linking issue while still providing the scheduling and analytics features I needed.

## 3. Outcome (115 words)

The final result is an automated social media workflow that reduces manual posting and keeps our community updated. Metricool allows me to create a post once, schedule it, and monitor performance (follower count and engagement) from a single dashboard. NotifyMe automatically sends a Discord notification whenever a new TikTok is uploaded, so our audience is informed instantly without extra effort.

This meets the task requirements because I implemented production-support tools that improve efficiency and reduce repetitive work as part of a wider development pipeline. The demonstrated functionality includes:linked social accounts inside Metricool, scheduled multi-platform posting, analytics tracking in one place, and a Discord channel that posts TikTok upload alerts with a role-based opt-in ping.
